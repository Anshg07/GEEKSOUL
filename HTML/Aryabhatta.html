            Aryabhata, first unmanned Earth satellite built by India. It was named for a prominent Indian astronomer and 
            mathematician of the 5th century CE. The satellite was assembled at Peenya, near Bangalore, but was launched from
             within the Soviet Union by a Russian-made rocket on April 19, 1975. Aryabhata weighed 794 pounds (360 kg) and was instrumented
              to explore conditions in Earth’s ionosphere, measure neutrons and gamma rays from the Sun, and perform 
              investigations in X-ray astronomy. The scientific instruments had to be switched off during the fifth day in 
              orbit because of a failure in the satellite’s electrical power system. Useful information, nevertheless, was collected during the five days of operation.
